# github-final-project

The purpose of this project is for me to host a micro-finance startup team's script to my repository as they work to move their code to git. Thus demonstrating for my professors that I can successfully:

- Create a new repository in my GitHub account.
- Select an appropriate license for your project.
- Create main README.md markdown file that explains the purpose of the project.
- Create Code of Conduct markdown that explains how you want the community to behave and interact with each other.
- Create Contribution Guidelines markdown that tells the community how to contribute.
- Commit new file to the repository.
